  # Command line RAEDME generator

  ## Description
  This is a command line README generator that uses nodejs and inquirer to prompt a user about what they would like to feature in a README.md file and then dynamically create that file. <br/>

  NOTE: THIS README you are currently veiwing is not the dynamically created version made by the app. To see a sample of the dynamically generated README, go into the dist folder of the project, in which will be the dynamically produced sample README.

  ## Installation
  This application uses node.js and requires inquirer package 8.2.4. To run this application, clone it into a repository on your computer locally. You will need to have node.js installed on your computer and run npm i inquirer@8.2.4 in the command line in the root directory of the repository to have the application be operational. You can then run index.js from the command line and answer the series of prompts/questions that are returned in the command line. Once all questions are answered, a new README will be generated in the dist folder for you to look at.
